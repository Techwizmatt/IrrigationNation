# IrrigationNation

This project was made for my School in my English 101 class, It will be shown at the world hunger fair for people to play and have fun learning about the struggles and basic lives of an Afganistan farmer...

# About the code:

The code is actually very simple for this project but it allows for a whole world of possibilities. The game runs within any web browser (preferably a chromium browser).

The main code is running inside the 'Game.js', the script or the scenarios that run the game are inside the 'options.json'. The 'game.js' kinda runs like a compiler for the code of 'options.json'. 

Take a look at the code and enjoy playing around with it!

(Don't judge for the crapping styling, I did not have a lot of time to make this project)

Uggh, the file organization is terrible I know! My OCD is killing me !!! :(
